Ultimate Goal: create a RCNN that detects people, in real time videos. 

I already know: 
	Basic CNN implementation
	Basic Neural network maths 
	Basic Matplotlib, numpy, and TensorFlow


I want to learn:
	How do the weights 'look' like?
	Difference between activation functions? 
	How to overcome limitations of my laptop?
	Where to get more data?
	How to pre-process data?
	How to generate more data?
